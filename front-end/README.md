# Front-end task of Code Challenge for Scoutbase

This task is for demonstrating your understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & related libraries.

If you’re doing the front-end only, you must use the https://countries.trevorblades.com endpoint for GraphQL API.

Preferred libraries:
  1. `styled-components` for styling
  2. `apollo-client` for consuming GraphQL API
  3. `react-router` or any alternative to implement routing

Instructions:

1. Create a `create-react-app` repo.
2. Add a router with routes:
  - `/` - for displaying basic links for the other routes
  - `/countries` - for requesting GraphQL API and rendering the list
  - `/countries/(:code)` - for requesting GraphQL API and rendering the properties of a continent
3. Design is totally by you.
4. Countries list at `/countries` must contain the list of countries and the languages spoken in that country. Both in English and native languages. It should also contain the continent it is located in.
5. `/countries/(:code)` must render the currency and a area code (phone) of that country.
6. Routes must be fully loadable with a direct link. `/countries/CI` must render the page for Ivory Coast, for example.
7. End.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
